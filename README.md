Project Title: Opinion Mining of Sanskrit Language Text Using Hybrid Approach
Objective:
The project aims to develop a desktop application for digitizing and translating Sanskrit texts using a hybrid approach that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to enhance the accuracy of Sanskrit text recognition and translation, especially from soiled and poorly maintained manuscripts.

Goals and Objectives:
Segmentation Framework: Develop a robust segmentation framework to digitize ancient Sanskrit texts, even if they are in poor condition.
CNN Implementation: Implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify and recognize Sanskrit characters.
Accuracy Improvement: Enhance recognition accuracy through machine learning techniques.
Character Recognition: Extract and recognize characters from images of Sanskrit texts.
Translation System: Implement a translation system for converting Sanskrit texts into English.
Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Java
Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras (for implementing CNNs)
Database: MySQL (for storing and managing data)
IDE: Eclipse (for Java development)
Application Server: Apache Tomcat 7.0 (for deploying Java applications)
Operating System: Windows 7
System Design:
Data Structures:

Global Data Structure: Utilizes a MySQL database for storing and managing data related to Sanskrit text recognition and translation.
Temporary Data Structure: No intermediate temporary files are used; data management is handled by the DBMS.
Database Description:

Schema: sanskrit
Tables:
tbl_Registration
tbl_data
Component Design:

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
Convolution Layer: Extracts features from images using filters for operations such as edge detection and blurring.
Pooling Layer: Reduces the dimensionality of feature maps while retaining important information.
Fully Connected Layer: Combines features to create a model for classification.
Softmax Classifier: Classifies outputs into various categories based on learned features.
Software Interface Description:

Operating System: Windows 7
Application Server: Apache Tomcat 7.0
Coding Language: Java
Database: MySQL
Tool: Eclipse
Application Type:

Desktop Application: The system is designed as a desktop application, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the digitization and translation functionalities of the software.
Testing Approach:
Unit Testing: Validates individual software units to ensure correct internal logic and output generation.
Integration Testing: Tests the integration of software components to ensure they work together as a cohesive system.
Functional Testing: Ensures that all functions of the system are available and perform as specified.
System Testing: Verifies that the entire system meets the specified requirements and functions correctly in a full integration.
White Box Testing: Involves testing with knowledge of the internal workings of the software.
Black Box Testing: Tests the software without knowledge of its internal structure, focusing on inputs and outputs.
Acceptance Testing: Ensures the system meets user requirements and functional specifications.
Applications:
Translation Applications: Facilitates the translation of ancient Sanskrit texts into English, making them accessible to a broader audience.
Design Constraints:
Time: The system should optimize the time required to recommend places based on user interests.
Cost: Estimated project costs will include development time and team size.
Scope: The project will mine user interests from social media and recommend places based on that data.
Conclusion:
The "Opinion Mining of Sanskrit Language Text Using Hybrid Approach" project integrates modern machine learning techniques with traditional text recognition methods in a desktop application format. By leveraging CNNs and advanced algorithms, the project aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of text recognition and translation, contributing to the preservation and accessibility of historical texts.
